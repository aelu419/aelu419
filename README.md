# Hello!
I'm a student at GT interested in graphics programming, both the visual and performance aspects of it.
Currently I am grinding LearnCPP, trying to optimize my use of C#'s Linq, and justifying putting my IDE on light mode.

I also made some games, mostly just as excuses for playing with graphics

And since it's all about numbers nowadays...
